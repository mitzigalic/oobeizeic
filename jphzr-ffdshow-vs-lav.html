                            <p>LAV has very good and clean code. It also support almost all formats that are supported by FFmpeg, while ffdshow only uses a subset of its functionality. Hi, I am just taking a new look at my post processing and seem to have forgotton everything. I currently use LAV splitter and LAV audio to bitstream. Okay, well, I have a problem here. I use headphones connected through my Denon receiver that uses HDMI to my PC. I noticed that LAV is now default. I haven't been able to get any videos to play smoothly with Whirligig until today, when I tried using the codec tweak tool to change the default decoder from LAV to ffdshow. ffdshow screws up the colors even worse than I expected, but overall it's a major improvement to 30 FPS-like.

Anyone use ffdshow + mpc-hc + svp?
